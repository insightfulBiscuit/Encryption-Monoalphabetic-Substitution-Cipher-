generate cipher method (parameters: original alphabet)
	while the cipher alphabet is less than 26 characters
		generates the random index
		will fetch the character from the original alphabet at the generated index
		if the character does not exist in the cipher alphabet
			the character will be added to the cipher alphabet

	return the cipher alphabet
generate cipher method end



encrypt method (parameters: original message, original alphabet, cipher alphabet)
	for every letter within the message
		stores character value
		if the character is within the cipher alphabet
			Stores the index of the letter
			if the character is lower case
				will add the lower case character from the cipher alphabet from the stored index to the message encrypt string
			else (the character is upper case)
				will add the upper case character from the cipher alphabet from the stored index to the message encrypt string
		
		else (the character is non-alphabetic)
			add that character to the message encrypt string

	returns the encrypted message
encrypt method end
